# foundryvtt-scripts

A list of random scripts for [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) in Javascript to make my life easier when I play as a Game Master, feel free to use them.

Currently, only French is supported.

# A hopefully updated list of scripts

## Converter

A simple tool to convert the most commonly used measurements in the imperial and metric systems.

Available conversion :
- Meters to feet
- Feet to Meters
- Kilograms to Pounds
- Pounds to Kilograms

The result is whispered to the user, meaning only they can see it.

# How to use

1. Create a Foundry VTT [script macro](https://foundryvtt.com/article/macros/).
2. Copy the code in the src/{script name} directory and past it in Foundry.
3. Enjoy.
